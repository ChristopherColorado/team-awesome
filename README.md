## USER STORY

As members of team-awesome, we wanted to created a web application so that we could allow users to determine where, what and...what they wanted to do based off their choices and allow those choices to provide a multitude of options. We also wanted to provide additional data to external sources where they can learn more and play an interactive, classic game to enhance their wildness knowledge.
